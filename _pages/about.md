!!! Under Construction !!!

I am a Research Associate and PhD Student in Linguistics at the University of Bayreuth. I am co-supervised by [Prof. Dr. Markus Bieswanger](https://www.english-linguistics2.uni-bayreuth.de/de/team/bieswanger/index.php) and [Prof. Dr. Ole Schützler](https://www.uni-leipzig.de/personenprofil/mitarbeiter/prof-dr-ole-schuetzler). 

My main interests include speech and language processing, computational linguistics, ASR, AI and all things phonetics. My research background is in Sociophonetics and Phonetics, but lately I am transitioning into computational linguistics with a focus on NLP and ASR.

Prior to my PhD studies, I completed a MSc and MScR in Linguistics at the University of Edinburgh, both with a focus on NLP and Phonetics, and BA studies in English/Politics/History at the Otto-Friedrich University Bamberg.
