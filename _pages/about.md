!!! UNDER CONSTRUCTION !!!

I am a Research Associate and PhD Student in Linguistics at the University of Bayreuth. I am co-supervised by Prof. Dr. Markus Bieswanger and Prof. Dr. Ole Schützler. 

My main interests include speech and language processing and all things phonetics. My research background is in Sociophonetics and Phonetics, but lately I am transitioning into corpus and grammar analysis, and computational linguistics.

Prior to my PhD studies, I completed a MSc and MScR in Linguistics at the University of Edinburgh and BA studies in English/Politics/History at the Otto-Friedrich University Bamberg.
